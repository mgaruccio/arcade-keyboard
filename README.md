Single key keyboard for Adafruit Trinket M0 with an arcade button!

Makes use of [this article](https://www.addictivetips.com/mac-os/run-an-applescript-with-a-keyboard-shortcut-on-macos/) which covers how to trigger an AppleScript with Automator when a particular keypress is received.

I made a Zoom panic switch using this, check out the [article with video on my website](https://simonprickett.dev/making-a-single-button-keyboard/).
